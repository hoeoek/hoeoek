### Här sitter jag och duger.

PhD student in forestry, working on creating a scandinavian auto-annoted image dataset towards computer vision applications in forest operations. 
I'm not in CS, although I kind of want to be.

Forester by trade, researcher by choice.

🌱 Currently playing with deep learning
🛸 Occasional side-hustle: UAV surveys (orthophoto mapping, volumetric measurements from photogrammetry)
💡 Bioacoustics + neural networks = prescriptive modeling for ecosystem health
