### Här sitter jag och duger.

PhD student in forestry, working on creating anautomatically collected and annotated image dataset towards computer vision applications in forest operations. 
I'm not in CS, although I kind of want to be.


🌱 Currently playing with deep learning
🛸 Occasional side-hustle: UAV surveys (orthophoto mapping, volumetric measurements/photogrammetry), GPT Assistant webapps
💡 Bioacoustics + neural networks = prescriptive modeling for ecosystem health
